# Next, add another test_getall() instance method to retrieve all the Menu objects added for the test purpose. 
# The retrieved objects must serialized, so make sure the method runs assertions to check if the serialized data equals the response.
# Run the test again with the command python manage.py test and verify if the test returns as OK.
